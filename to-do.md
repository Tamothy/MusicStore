Change Add/Edit to reflect Adding music to cart and editing/removing from your cart

Have a total add up for the cart purchases

Edit Design assets


Need:

-When you hit the "Add" button it will add to the cart

-When you hit "View Cart" it will display in the sidebar - you can toggle this (?) or maybe have it automatically update as you add (?)

-An edit button will be in the "View Cart" window and it should pop
up check boxes to remove items and have a remove button as well that replaces the edit button.
